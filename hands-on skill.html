      <p class = "text">Hands-on skills are abilities acquired
	  through active engagement and practical learning rather than

	  these skills by practicing what they're learning immediately. 
	  This is an influential and integral part of gaining other 
	  vital skills as a skilled laborer, as developing hands-on 
	  skills can help you increase your focus, attention and 
	  engagement.</p>
